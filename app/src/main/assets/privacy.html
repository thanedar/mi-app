    <li><strong> Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong>

        <p>Some non-personally identifiable information and statistical data is collected and stored
            automatically when a User visits the Website. If a User does nothing during its visit
            but browse through the Website, read pages or download information, CASHGURU will gather
            and store certain statistical information about your visit automatically. This
            information does not identify a User personally. CASHGURU system collects data in the
            server log that may include: IP address, domain name, type of browser, operating system,
            online activity (including, without limitation, pages viewed, search requests, and
            transactions made). If a User linked to the Website from another web site, that
            website's address may be logged. CASHGURU may collate and aggregate this data and use it
            for statistical purposes. E.g., the aggregated data helps CASHGURU to determine the
            volume of its Website users' interest in areas of the Website. It also helps CASHGURU
            understand how it can improve the navigation and content of the Website. CASHGURU may
            disclose this information to third parties.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong> Cookies</strong>

        <p>Non-personal information may also be collected with the use of cookies. "Cookies" are
            small text files a website can use to recognize repeat users. When someone visits the
            Website, a cookie is placed on the User&rsquo;s machine (provided that the visitor's web
            browser has been set to accept cookies) or is read if the visitor has visited the
            Website previously. CASHGURU may collect aggregated Website-visitation statistics using
            cookies. For example, every time you log in to the Website, CASHGURU may record your
            member ID and the name of your member account in the cookie file on your computer. Your
            password may also be recorded in this cookie file if you selected the &ldquo;Save this
            password for automatic log-in&rdquo; feature or similar options. If the User does not
            wish to accept cookies it should set its web browser to reject cookies or to warn the
            User prior to accepting cookies.</p>
