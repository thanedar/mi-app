</p>
<p><span>PLEASE NOTE THAT ARBITRATION IS MORE INFORMAL THAN LITIGATION. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN AN ARBITRATION PROCEEDING BUT THERE IS A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD AND THE PROCEDURES MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN IN A COURT. ARBITRATION ALLOWS FOR MORE LIMITED DISCOVERY AND LIMITED APPELLATE REVIEW BUT AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT, INCLUDING ATTORNEYS' FEES, IF APPLICABLE.</span>
</p>
<p><span>PLEASE ALSO NOTE THAT THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS IS AN INTERSTATE COMMERCE TRANSACTION. CONSEQUENTLY, THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT ("FAA") GOVERNS THE INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.</span>
</p>
<p><span>In addition, you and CashGuru both agree that:</span></p>
<ol>
    <li><span> Reference to "CashGuru" includes its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors, successors, assigns, and its directors, officers, employees and agents. Reference to "you" includes your heirs, personal representative and all beneficiaries of this agreement and these Terms and Conditions and all users of the products and/or services provided under these Terms and Conditions.</span>
    </li>
    <li><span> BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, AND/OR ACCEPTING THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND/OR USING THE SERVICES AND/OR THE SITES, YOU AND CASHGURU ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL ("JURY TRIAL WAIVER") OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR CLASS ARBITRATION ("CLASS ACTION WAIVER"), INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CLASS ACTIONS OR CLASS ARBITRATIONS BEGUN BY OTHERS PRIOR TO THE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT EVEN IF APPLICABLE LAW OR THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION RULES WOULD ALLOW IT. YOU AND CASHGURU MAY EACH BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDINGS. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD DECLARATORY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM. IF THIS PARAGRAPH TWO (2) IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE SHALL NOT APPLY.</span>
    </li>
    <li><span> Any claim must first be brought to the attention of the other party by sending a written notice ("Claim Notice") to (a) your then-current (or last provided) billing address, or (b) to CashGuru at P.O. Box 3315, New York, NY 10008-3315. In the unlikely event that the claim is not resolved within thirty (30) days after the Claim Notice is received, you or CashGuru may commence arbitration proceedings pursuant to paragraph (4) below. Click here for a Claim Notice form.</span>
    </li>
    <li><span> The arbitration will be governed by the Wireless Industry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA Rules"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available by visiting www.adr.org or by calling +1 (800) 778-7879.</span>

        <p><span>Unless you and CashGuru agree otherwise, the arbitration will take place in the County (or equivalent) of your billing address, provided, however, that if your billing address is outside of the United States, the arbitration will take place in New York County, New York. There will be one single neutral arbitrator appointed pursuant to the AAA Rules. If your claim is for $10,000.00 or less, you can choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, or by a hearing in-person or by phone. If your claim exceeds $10,000.00, arbitration proceedings will be carried out in accordance with the AAA Rules. CashGuru may reimburse you for all AAA filings, administration and arbitrator fees (collectively the "Arbitration Fees") for any arbitration proceedings commenced in accordance with this Dispute Resolution and Arbitration section. In the event you cannot pay the Arbitration Fees, you may request in the Claim Notice that CashGuru pay the Arbitration Fees directly. If, however, the arbitrator finds that your claim, its substance or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, you agree to reimburse CashGuru for all monies disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. The arbitration award shall be final and binding upon both you and CashGuru. The language of the arbitration shall be English.</span>
        </p></li>
    <li><span> UNLESS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS DISPUTE AND ARBITRATION SECTION, EACH PARTY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS/HER/ITS OWN ATTORNEY'S FEES, THE EXPENSES OF HIS/HER/ITS OWN WITNESSES, EXPERTS AND/OR INTERPRETERS AND ALL OTHER EXPENSES CONNECTED WITH PRESENTING THE CASE.</span>
    </li>
    <li><span> An arbitration award and any judgment confirming such award apply only to that specific case and cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award itself.</span>
    </li>
    <li><span> The provisions set forth in this Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Section do not preclude you from bringing any issues you may have to the attention of federal, state or local government agencies, including, for example, the Federal Trade Commission, and if the law allows, such agencies can seek relief against CashGuru on your behalf.</span>
    </li>
    <li><span> The provisions set forth in this Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement or your contractual relationship with CashGuru.</span>
    </li>
    <li><span> NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, EITHER YOU OR CASHGURU MAY ELECT TO BRING AN INDIVIDUAL ACTION IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT IF THE CASE QUALIFIES UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.</span>

        <p><span>In the event that the agreement to arbitrate set forth above shall not apply, you agree that any legal action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with this agreement and/or Terms and Conditions or any document related thereto shall be commenced in the courts of the State of New York located in New York County or of the United States of America for the Southern District of New York. By visiting and/or or using or attempting to use the Services and/or the Site you unconditionally accept and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the aforesaid courts. You consent that personal jurisdiction may be obtained over you by mailing a summons by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, within or without such court's jurisdiction, or by personal service, provided a reasonable time for appearance is allowed. You irrevocably waive any objection, including, without limitation, any objection to the laying of venue based on the grounds of forum non conveniens, which it may now or hereafter have to the bringing of any such action or proceeding in such jurisdictions. Nothing herein shall affect the right of CashGuru to serve process in any manner other than as set forth herein, as permitted by law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against you in any other jurisdiction.</span>
        </p>

        <p><span>To the maximum extent permitted by law, you expressly WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY of any action, claim, demand, or proceeding arising under or with respect to this agreement and/or these Terms and Conditions, or in any way connected with, related to, or incidental to the dealings between them with respect to this agreement and/or these Terms and Conditions, or the transactions related thereto, in each case whether now existing or hereafter arising, and whether sounding in contract, tort or otherwise.</span>
